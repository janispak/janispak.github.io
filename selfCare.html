      <h3> What does self-care mean to me?</h3>
      <p class="text">Self-care to me is keeping a calm, clutter-free, organized mind. It is taking care of my whole self, including my physical and mental health. It is being mindful of meeting deadlines and doing the necessary planning to make that happen. It is also making time for things that don’t have formal deadlines but that are important to keep myself feeling well. One of the most important things to me about self-care is giving myself grace. While self-care routines are good and build discipline, I value listening to body and mind which involves checking in with myself everyday.</p>
